                Zander Gibney is a Junior here at UNO. He is pursuing a BS in IT Innovation as well as 
                three minors in Theatre, Screenwriting, and Computer Science. In his free time, Zander
                loves to write, read, watch films, play video games, play D&D, and so many more things.
                Zander, as often as he can, loves to get involved in the Omaha theatre community and
                make short films on his YouTube channel "Lettuce Rock Productions"! He's performed in 5 
                (soon to be 6) productions at UNO, including "The Wind in the Willows" and "The Curious 
                Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime".
