Website for Activity 2

Website title is "Zander Gibney" and displays 3 pictures:

  - One of my brother and me at a wedding.
  - One of me after a production of "The Wind in the Willows".
  - One of me working on a Theatrical Lighting project.

A small paragraph is displayed describing myself in more detail.

Two links are provided on the main page:

  - One link takes you to my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzBZX_O3WIW8j1c5TOSuwLg)
  - One link takes you to a page showing pictures from various theatre productions I've been involved in.

This assignment was my first experience using GitHub and one of my first experiences with HTML and CSS.

Excited for learning more throughout the rest of this class!
